 * A diffnode in a diffpath.

 * A DiffNode and its previous node mark a delta between two input sequences,
 * that is, two differing subsequences between (possibly zero length) matching
 * sequences.
 * 
 * {@link DiffNode DiffNodes} and {@link Snake Snakes} allow for compression of
 * diffpaths, as each snake is represented by a single {@link Snake Snake} node
 * and each contiguous series of insertions and deletions is represented by a
 * single {@link DiffNode DiffNodes}.
